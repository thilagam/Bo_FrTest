NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS In statistics and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis,  a dummy variable (also known as an indicator variable,###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS design variable, Boolean indicator, categorical variable, binary variable, or qualitative variable[1][2]) adasas###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS is one that takes the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome.[3][4] Dummy variables are used as devices to sort data into###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS exclusive categories (such as smoker/non-smoker, etc.).[2] For example, in econometric time series analysis, dummy variables may be used to indicate the occurrence of wars or major strikes. A dummy variable can thus be###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS thought of as a truth value represented as a numerical value 0 or 1 (as is sometimes done in computer programming).  Dummy variables are "proxy"###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS output, prices, etc.), but also by qualitative variables (gender, religion, geographic region, etc.). A dummy independent variable (also called a dummy explanatory variable) which for some observation has a value of 0###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS will cause that variable's coefficient to have no role in influencing the dependent variable, while when the dummy takes on a value 1 its coefficient acts to alter the intercept. For example, suppose Gender###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS qualitative variables relevant to a regression. Then, female and male would be the categories included under the Gender variable. If female is arbitrarily assigned the value of 1, then male would get the value 0.[1]###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS hen the intercept (the value of the dependent variable if all other explanatory variables hypothetically took on the value zero) would be the constant term for males but would be the constant term plus the coefficient of###$$$###NAME  AVTROPICALWINTERTEMP  2TROPICALWINTERMONTHS Dummy variables are used frequently in time series analysis with regime switching, seasonal analysis and qualitative data applications.
