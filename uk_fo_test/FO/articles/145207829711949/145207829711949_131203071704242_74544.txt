The micro-environment in which the snowflake grows changes dynamically as the snowflake falls through the cloud, 3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS  and tiny changes in temperature and humidity affect the way in which water molecules attach to the snowflake. Since the micro-environment (and its changes) are very nearly identical around the snowflake, 3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS each arm can grow in nearly the same way. However, being in the same micro-environment does not guarantee that each arm grow the same; indeed, for some crystal forms it does not because the underlying c  3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS  crystal growth mechanism also affects how fast each surface region of a crystal grows.[10] Empirical studies suggest less than 0.1% of snowflakes exhibit the ideal six-fold symmetric shape.[11] 3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS Snowflakes form in a wide variety of intricate shapes, leading to the popular expression that "no two are alike". Although possible, it is very unlikely.[7][12][13] Initial attempts to find i  3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS identical snowflakes by photographing thousands of them with a microscope from 1885 onward by Wilson Alwyn Bentley found the wide variety of snowflakes we know about today.  3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS  n 1988, Nancy Knight was documenting snowflakes for the National Center for Atmospheric Research and found two identical snowflakes of the hollow column type.[14] 3FREQUENTSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS  The snowflake is often a traditional seasonal image or motif used around the Christmas period, especially in Europe, the United States and Canada.

During this period, it is quite popular to make paper snowflakes by folding a piece of paper several times, cutting out a pattern with scissors and then unfolding it.[15][16]###$$$###NAME  AVFREQUENTSNOWAMOUNTS Snowflakes are also often used as symbols representing winter or cold conditions.
