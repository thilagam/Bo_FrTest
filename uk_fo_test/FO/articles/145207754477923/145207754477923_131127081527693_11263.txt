NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS A non-aggregated snowflake often exhibits six-fold radial symmetry. The initial symmetry can occur[9] because the crystalline structure of ice is six-fold.

It has an open and therefore soft, white, and fluffy structure, unless subjected to external pressure.

Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are to hundreds of microme  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME hat the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters,  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.[5] Guinness World Records list the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana 3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS ; allegedly one measured 15 inches (38 cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime have been observed.[1]###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  The exact details of the sticking mechanism remain controversial. Possibilities include mechanical interlocking, sintering, electrostatic attraction as well as the existence of a "sticky" liquid-like layer on the crystal surfac  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  The individual ice crystals often have hexagonal symmetry. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.[2] The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it .[5] Rarely,  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS###$$$###NAME  AVHEAVYSNOWAMOUNT  3HEAVYSNOWMONTHS at a temperature of around −2 °C (28 °F), snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes.[6] The most common snow particles are visibly irregular,
